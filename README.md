# List of tweaks I host here:
- SCAlwaysLowPowerMode - Permanently enable Snapchat's power saving mode.
- NetworkBars (removed due to issues) - Display android-like upload/download bars next to 3G/LTE and WiFi signal bars.
- Ah! Ah! Ah! Fix for iOS 9 - Awaiting permission to upload from original dev.

# Tweaks in development/on todo list:
- HotspotBars - Show signal strength and connection type (EDGE, 3G, LTE) of personal hotspot host. ETA unknown.
- NotificationFaker - Send custom push notifications from an app. Trying to fix bug that breaks native notifications in apps you use it on (RIP my messages app -_-)

All of my tweaks are open source. You can find their source code here.
